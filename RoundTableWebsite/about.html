          Steadily progressing in the technology world, while helping entry
          level developers land their first tech job.<br><br> For the last decade I have
          been a working in the restaurant industry, in varying levels of
          expertise. I have been a Head Chef for the last 3 years. Now I am
          looking to expand my skill set into a new industry. Recently I
          graduated from The Tech Academy, and have since taken on the role of
          their Job Placement Director and Deputy VP for Quality. <br><br>My goal is to
          continue to advance in the industry and try to challenge myself and
          those around me every day. Currently I am coding mostly in C#, Python
          and JavaScript but I am also proficient in HTML 5, CSS 3, and SQL. I
          also host a weekly tech talk on meetup every Friday.
